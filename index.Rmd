I'm Dhafer Malouche, I'm a Professor of Statistics at the [University of Carthage](http://www.ucar.rnu.tn/En/). I'm teaching at the [*Ecole Sup√©rieure de la Statistique et de l'Analyse de l'Information*](http://www.essai.rnu.tn/accueil.htm)  several data science courses: Big Data, Computing tools for Statistics such as `R` and Python, Bayesian Statistics and Time Series.
